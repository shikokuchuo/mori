# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

mori — Shared Memory for R Objects. Uses POSIX shared memory (Linux, macOS) and Win32 file mappings (Windows) with R's ALTREP framework to let multiple processes on the same machine read the same physical memory pages. No external dependencies. Requires R >= 4.3.0 (for ALTLIST). API: `share()` → ALTREP shared object, `map_shared()` → open SHM by name, `shared_name()` → extract identifier, `is_shared()` → test if shared, `prune_shared()` → remove orphaned regions of dead processes. ALTREP serialization hooks emit the `shared_name()` identifier as the wire form — transparent under `serialize()` and `mirai`.

## Development Commands

Standard R-package workflow (`devtools::test()`, `devtools::document()`, `R CMD build` / `R CMD check`). Run a single test file with `testthat::test_file("tests/testthat/test-nested.R")`.

## Storage Model

- **Zero-copy (SHM-backed)**: All atomic vectors (any type, any attributes) and data frame columns are written directly into SHM and backed by ALTREP on consumers. Attributes serialize into a trailing region and are reapplied on the consumer. Numeric `Dataptr_or_null` returns the SHM pointer; `Dataptr(writable=TRUE)` triggers COW into a private copy. String `Elt` lazily creates CHARSXPs; `Dataptr_or_null` returns NULL to force per-element access.
- **Nested lists (zero-copy)**: VECSXP/LISTSXP elements of a shared list are written inline as a complete child MORL region at their `data_offset`; each level wraps in its own ALTLIST. `is_shared()` returns TRUE for sub-lists; `shared_name()` returns a path-bearing identifier; `map_shared(shared_name(sub))` opens the addressed sub-list / element directly. The OS-level region name is the prefix before `[` and is recoverable via `sub("\\[.*$", "", shared_name(x))`.
- **Pass-through**: All other R objects (environments, closures, language objects, NULL) are returned unchanged. No SHM is created.

## Concurrency Model

mori is **write-once on host, read-many on consumers, COW for any mutation.** Each `share()` allocates a new SHM region with a unique name; existing regions are never mutated. The name embeds the creator PID (`mori_<pid>_<counter>`); `mori_shm_create` opens with `O_EXCL` (POSIX) / checks `ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS` (Windows); a name that already exists — an orphan left by a crashed same-PID process — is surfaced as an error (`MORI_EEXIST`), never worked around by reusing or mutating the existing region. `prune_shared()` is the mechanism for clearing such orphans; it must run while the PID is free (before reuse), since the colliding process reads its own PID as alive and so cannot reap them itself. The host writes the full region inside `mori_create` before returning, and consumers obtain the name only after that call returns — partial writes are not observable. Consumer mappings are read-only (`PROT_READ` / `FILE_MAP_READ`); mutations trigger COW into private memory. No locking is implemented or required; any future change admitting in-place mutation breaks this model.

## share() Dispatch (`altrep.c: mori_create`)

All R exported functions are single `.Call` wrappers. `mori_create` dispatches on `TYPEOF(x)`:

0. Already a mori-backed ALTREP (`mori_owned_tag` on `R_altrep_data1(x)`) → return `x` unchanged. Idempotence required: re-sharing a sub-list view must not allocate a fresh root region (would break `shared_name()`).
1. `NILSXP` → returned as-is.
2. `VECSXP`/`LISTSXP` → `mori_shm_create_list_call` — ALTLIST with per-element directory. Pairlists are coerced to VECSXP at every level. Data frames go through this path.
3. `STRSXP` → `mori_shm_create_string_call` — ALTSTRING with offset table + packed strings.
4. SHM-eligible atomics (`REALSXP`, `INTSXP`, `LGLSXP`, `RAWSXP`, `CPLXSXP`) → `mori_shm_create_vector_call`.
5. Everything else → returned as-is.

Each path returns via `mori_make_result`, which chains the host extptr into the ALTREP's keeper chain (see Internal State and Lifetime).

### Two-pass write invariant

Writing into SHM is count-then-write in two flavours: `mori_serialize_count` / `mori_serialize_into` (serialize.c, fallback serialized bytes) and the recursive `mori_nested_size` / `mori_nested_write` (altrep.c, whole MORL regions). **If the count and the writer disagree by even one byte, the SHM region is malformed and consumers will read garbage.** Any change to either side must be mirrored in the other.

## ALTREP Classes

Registered in `mori_altrep_init`. Numeric types — `mori_real`, `mori_integer`, `mori_logical`, `mori_raw`, `mori_complex` — share the `mori_vec` pattern with a SHM-backed data pointer. `mori_string` uses `mori_str` with lazy per-element access via `Elt` and `Rf_mkCharLenCE`. `mori_list` uses `mori_list_view` with a per-element directory and a lazy `Elt` cache that uses `R_NilValue` as the "uncached" sentinel — a fresh VECSXP is naturally R_NilValue-filled, so cache init is zero work. NIL-valued elements are the sole singleton output of `mori_unwrap_element`'s fallback path, so they aren't cached; re-extraction returns the same `R_NilValue` and identity is preserved for free.

### COW invariant for new ALTREP methods

Any method returning a writable pointer (or mutating) **must check `R_altrep_data2(x)` first** — if non-null, the vector has been materialized to a private copy and the SHM pointer is no longer authoritative. New `Dataptr` / coercion methods routinely forget this. `Dataptr_or_null` returns the materialized copy when data2 is set, the SHM pointer otherwise.

## ALTREP Serialization Hooks

All classes register `Serialized_state` and `Unserialize`.

- **Identifier wire form (single canonical shape)**. `mori_format_chain` is the single source of truth used by both `mori_shm_name` (the `.Call`) and the three `Serialized_state` methods. Walks the keeper chain through `mori_owned_tag` hops collecting `view->index` (`>= 0` only) and formats `<prefix>` (root) or `<prefix>[i1+1,...]` (sub-object) into a caller-provided stack buffer. `shm->name_len` is cached at create/open time (no per-call `strlen`). 1-based externalisation cues R's `[[i]]` semantics; the parser converts back to 0-based.
- **Unserialize**. `mori_Unserialize` delegates STRSXP × 1 state to `mori_shm_open_and_wrap`; on parse-success it returns the opened ALTREP, on parse-failure it falls through to expanded-state handling (the COW-materialized ALTSTRING case). `mori_shm_open_and_wrap` runs `mori_parse_identifier`: prefix-only routes through magic-dispatch; path form routes through `mori_open_path_c`, which walks each intermediate VECSXP directory via `mori_make_view_extptr` (bare keeper-chain extptr — no ALTLIST wrapper, no attribute restoration, since intermediates are never observed) and calls `mori_unwrap_element` at the leaf.

Fallback to full materialization when:
- COW-materialized vectors (data2 is set) — returns the materialized copy.
- Nesting depth exceeds `MORI_MAX_PATH` (64) in `mori_format_chain`.

### Identifier grammar

```
identifier ::= prefix [ "[" int1 ("," int1)* "]" ]
prefix     ::= MORI_PREFIX_LITERAL hex+ "_" hex+
hex+       ::= [0-9a-f]+         # one or more, lowercase
int1       ::= [1-9][0-9]*       # 1-based, no leading zeros
```

`MORI_PREFIX_LITERAL` (in `mori.h`) is `/mori_` (POSIX) / `Local\\mori_` (Windows) and is the **single source of truth shared between `shm.c`'s name-format strings** (`MORI_PREFIX_LITERAL "%x_%x"` POSIX, `MORI_PREFIX_LITERAL "%lx_%x"` Windows) and the parser's literal `memcmp`. Change once; both sides stay in sync. Names are variable-width hex (no zero-padding); `MORI_NAME_MAX = 30` bounds the prefix on either platform (Windows worst case: `Local\\mori_<8hex>_<8hex>` = 28 chars + NUL).

`mori_parse_identifier` is bounded and single-pass (length-capped by `MORI_IDENTIFIER_MAX`); indices are externalised 1-based and stored 0-based. The path-parse loop relies on NUL-termination as a sentinel (every fail-branch's predicate excludes `\0`), so trailing `p < eos` checks aren't needed there. Sizing invariant: `MORI_NAME_MAX + 2 + 11 × MORI_MAX_PATH < MORI_FORMAT_BUFLEN`.

### Validation contract

`map_shared` and unserialize share `mori_parse_identifier` for shape validation but differ in failure mode: **malformed input → `NULL`** (wrong type/length, `NA`, missing or malformed prefix, malformed bracketed path); **well-formed identifier that fails to map → error** (missing region, bad magic, truncated header, OOB path index, non-VECSXP intermediate). Preserve this split in `mori_shm_open_and_wrap`: collapsing it either way breaks the probe-vs-corruption distinction.

## SHM Region Layouts

Magic identifier in the first 4 bytes: MORH (`0x4D4F5248`) atomic vector, MORL (`0x4D4F524C`) ALTLIST, MORS (`0x4D4F5253`) ALTSTRING. The tables below are the canonical spec; `mori_serialize_into` and `mori_nested_write` are the implementations.

**MORH — atomic vector.** 64-byte header, data starts at byte 64 (64-byte aligned for SIMD). Trailing serialized attributes (if any) follow the data.

| Offset | Size | Field |
|--------|------|-------|
| 0 | 4 | magic (`0x4D4F5248`) |
| 4 | 4 | sexptype (REALSXP, INTSXP, etc.) |
| 8 | 8 | length (int64) |
| 16 | 8 | attrs_size (int64, 0 if no attributes) |
| 24 | 40 | reserved (zero) |
| 64+ | | raw vector data |
| 64 + length×elt_size | | serialized attributes (`attrs_size` bytes, if > 0) |

Attributes are a serialized R object (pairlist on R < 4.6, named list otherwise); `mori_restore_attrs` unserializes and reapplies them on the consumer.

**MORL — ALTLIST.** Header + element directory + per-element data regions.

| Offset | Size | Field |
|--------|------|-------|
| 0 | 4 | magic (`0x4D4F524C`) |
| 4 | 4 | n_elements (int32) |
| 8 | 8 | attrs_offset (int64) |
| 16 | 8 | attrs_size (int64) |
| 24 | 32×n | element directory |
| varies | | element data (64-byte aligned) |
| varies | | serialized attributes |

Each directory entry (32 bytes): `data_offset(8) + data_size(8) + sexptype(4) + attrs_size(4) + length(8)`. `sexptype` semantics: `0` → serialized bytes (via serialize.c); `STRSXP` → offset table + packed strings at `data_offset`; `VECSXP` → nested MORL region inlined at `data_offset` of size `data_size` (child's own header / directory / elements / attrs all inline; parent's `attrs_size` is always 0 for VECSXP children); other → raw zero-copy data. For non-VECSXP entries with `attrs_size > 0`, attrs are appended within the data region at `data_offset + data_size - attrs_size`.

**MORS — ALTSTRING.** 24-byte header + offset table + packed string bytes + optional trailing attributes.

| Offset | Size | Field |
|--------|------|-------|
| 0 | 4 | magic (`0x4D4F5253`) |
| 4 | 4 | attrs_size (int32, 0 if none) |
| 8 | 8 | n_strings (int64) |
| 16 | 8 | str_data_size (int64, byte distance from start of offset table to end of packed strings; includes alignment padding) |
| 24 | 16×n | offset table |
| 24 + align64(16×n) | | packed string bytes |
| 24 + str_data_size | | serialized attributes (`attrs_size` bytes, if > 0) |

Each offset table entry (16 bytes): `str_offset(int64) + str_length(int32) + str_encoding(int32)`. `str_offset` is relative to the start of the packed string area. `str_length < 0` means `NA_STRING`. `str_encoding` is a `cetype_t` (0=native, 1=UTF-8, 2=Latin-1, 3=bytes). The same layout is used inline for STRSXP elements within ALTLIST regions (offset table starts at the element's `data_offset`; element-level attrs use the directory entry's `attrs_size` field).

## Internal State and Lifetime

SHM lifetime is fully automatic via chained external pointer finalizers. Three interned symbols (C globals in `altrep.c`):

- **`mori_shm_tag`** (`Rf_install("mori_shm")`) — tags the SHM mapping extptr (host- and consumer-side). Addr is `mori_shm *`; finalizer: `munmap`.
- **`mori_host_tag`** (`Rf_install("mori_host")`) — tags the host-only unlink extptr created by `mori_make_result`. Addr is `mori_shm *` carrying `name` (POSIX) or `HANDLE` (Windows); finalizer: `shm_unlink` / `CloseHandle`. Sits above the shm terminus in the keeper chain.
- **`mori_owned_tag`** (`Rf_install("mori_owned")`) — tags every malloc-backed extptr in the keeper chain: each mori ALTREP's `data1` extptr (view, vec, or str) **and** the bare keeper-chain extptrs created by `mori_make_view_extptr` for path-walk intermediates (which have no ALTREP wrapper but still hold a `mori_list_view *`). Addr type for ALTREP data1 is recovered from `TYPEOF(x)` at the ALTREP boundary: `VECSXP → mori_list_view *`, `STRSXP → mori_str *`, else `mori_vec *`. Bare keeper-chain hops are always `mori_list_view *` (vec/str only ever appear as leaves). Standalone-vs-element carried in each struct's `index` field (`-1` standalone/root, `>= 0` element/sub-list); redundantly recoverable from `data1.prot`'s tag (`shm_tag → standalone`, `owned_tag → element/sub-list`). Common finalizer: `mori_owned_finalizer` `free`s the addr.

`is_shared()` is a pointer comparison against `mori_owned_tag`. `mori_shm_name()` invokes `mori_format_chain` to emit the bare prefix for roots / standalones and the path-bearing form (`<prefix>[i1,i2,...]`, 1-based) for sub-objects.

### Keeper chain

- **Host side (`share`)**: `mori_shm_create` allocates and mmaps the region; the POSIX fd is closed after mmap (mapping stays valid). `mori_make_result` splits ownership — the ALTREP wrapper gets the mapping via the `mori_shm_tag` extptr (finalizer → `munmap`); the host extptr (`mori_host_tag`, finalizer → `shm_unlink` / `CloseHandle`) is chained as that extptr's `prot`. Both finalizers run when the ALTREP is GC'd. `R_RegisterCFinalizerEx(..., TRUE)` covers session exit.
- **Consumer side (`map_shared` / unserialize)**: `mori_shm_open` maps read-only (size via `fstat` / `VirtualQuery`); POSIX fd closed after mmap (Windows: handle retained until `UnmapViewOfFile`). The shm extptr's finalizer is `munmap` only — never unlink. For lists opened by prefix, the shm extptr's immediate child is a root view extptr (`mori_list_view *`, index=-1) that becomes ALTREP data1; sub-lists accessed via `Elt` (index >= 0) chain through their parent view extptr the same way. For path-form `map_shared("/mori_x_y[i,j,...]")`, intermediate hops are bare keeper-chain extptrs (`mori_make_view_extptr`, no ALTLIST) — only the leaf's ALTREP exists. The chain shape is identical for `mori_format_chain`'s purposes either way. Element vectors hold a `mori_vec` / `mori_str` extptr whose `prot` is the immediate parent view (or the shm extptr for vec/str at the root).
- **Element lifetime**: leaves keep the root SHM alive through the chain (leaf → parent view(s) → shm extptr → host extptr). Every `R_MakeExternalPtr` retains its `prot`, so the chain survives even if enclosing ALTLIST(s) are GC'd. `mori_format_chain` is the only chain walker: it walks `mori_owned_tag` hops (always `mori_list_view *` — vec/str extptrs are only ever leaves), collecting view indices (skipping the root view's -1) until it hits the shm extptr.

## Code Organization

### src/

- **mori.h** — types (`mori_shm`, `mori_buf`, `mori_vec` with `index` field, `mori_list_view`), declarations, `MORI_ALIGN64`, `mori_sizeof_elt`, and the identifier grammar constants (`MORI_NAME_MAX`, `MORI_MAX_PATH`, `MORI_IDENTIFIER_MAX`, `MORI_FORMAT_BUFLEN`, `MORI_PREFIX_LITERAL`).
- **shm.c** — platform SHM create/open/close + finalizers for both sides. `mori_shm_reap` enumerates the platform's name source (`#ifdef`-selected) — `/dev/shm` on Linux (entries are region names), the per-user registry dir on macOS (per-process logs; see Platform Notes) — classifies by the PID embedded in the name via `mori_pid_alive` (Linux unlinks each dead-PID region directly; macOS reads each dead-PID log via `mori_reap_log` and unlinks the regions it names), and feeds the shared per-name core `mori_reap_unlink` (shm_unlink + record-on-reclaim). Windows / other POSIX cannot reap → `NULL` / `*n == 0`. `mori_shm_os_unlink` is the single region-unlink seam (host finalizer, create-fail, reap) and is pure `shm_unlink`; the macOS registry is decoupled from it and managed by `mori_log_append` / `mori_log_release` (see Platform Notes). Reap semantics A, both platforms: a dead-PID region is reported removed only when `shm_unlink` actually reclaimed it, so concurrent reaps never double-report. Error path: `mori_err_classify` (static; native errno / GetLastError → portable `MORI_E*` category) and `mori_err_describe` (category summary + platform remediation hint); `mori_shm_create` / `mori_shm_create_heap` return `MORI_OK` or a failure category, classifying the native code **before** any `close` / `unlink` / `CloseHandle` clobbers `errno` / `GetLastError`.
- **serialize.c** — `mori_serialize_count`, `mori_serialize_into`, `mori_unserialize_from`. Used for fallback (non-zero-copy) ALTLIST entries where directory `sexptype == 0`.
- **altrep.c** — all ALTREP class definitions, `mori_create` dispatcher, recursive writers (`mori_nested_size` / `mori_nested_write`), consumer open+wrap (`mori_shm_open_and_wrap`), path open (`mori_open_path_c`), view constructors (`mori_make_view_extptr` for bare keeper-chain extptrs, `mori_make_list_view` for full ALTLIST + attrs), identity/name (`mori_is_shared` / `mori_shm_name`), identifier formatter / parser (`mori_format_chain` / `mori_parse_identifier`), serialization hooks, `mori_altrep_init`. The create-failure message lives in `mori_shm_create_failed`, which composes the requested size (`mori_format_bytes`) with `mori_err_describe`'s summary + hint into a single `Rf_error`.
- **init.c** — `R_init_mori`, `.Call` registration table (5 entries: `mori_create`, `mori_shm_open_and_wrap`, `mori_is_shared`, `mori_shm_name`, `mori_prune`).

`.Call` names match C function names; all entry points take a single `SEXP` except `mori_prune`, which takes none.

### R/

`mori-package.R` (package docs) and `share.R` (five `.Call` wrappers — dispatch and error handling are at the C level; `prune_shared()` delegates to `mori_prune`, which returns `NULL` when nothing was pruned). `import-standalone-defer.R` is a vendored copy of withr's `defer()` (`usethis::use_standalone("r-lib/withr", "defer")`) used only by tests — do not edit by hand; refresh via `use_standalone`.

## Testing

testthat edition 3. Entry point `tests/testthat.R`; tests in `tests/testthat/test-*.R` grouped by topic (each file's `desc()` strings are authoritative). All tests run unconditionally — nothing gated behind `skip_on_cran` or environment variables.

## Platform Notes

- **Linux**: SHM in `/dev/shm/` (tmpfs). Accessed via `open()` / `unlink()` directly to avoid the `-lrt` link dependency that `shm_open` requires. `MAP_POPULATE` pre-faults pages.
- **macOS**: Kernel-backed SHM via `shm_open` / `shm_unlink` (in libc, no extra link flags). `MAP_POPULATE` is a no-op (defined to 0). The kernel POSIX-shm namespace has no filesystem footprint and cannot be enumerated (invisible to `ipcs` / `lsof` once the creator dies), so orphan reaping relies on a per-user registry under `TMPDIR` (resolved via `$TMPDIR`, then `confstr(_CS_DARWIN_USER_TEMP_DIR)`, then `/tmp`) that `mori_shm_reap` scans in place of `/dev/shm`. The registry must live in an enumerable namespace — putting it in SHM would face the same non-enumerability wall — so it is filesystem-backed, but to keep the per-`share()` cost off the critical path it is **one append-only log per process** (`<dir>/mori_<pid>`) rather than a file per region: `mori_log_append` (called in `mori_shm_create` before the region is observable) opens the log lazily on first share and appends one line per region name — a single `write()` (~1 µs) vs creating a file (~40 µs on APFS, where neither path resolution nor a cached dir fd helps because the cost is inode allocation + journaling). Single-writer per process ⇒ no locking; the only reader is a reaper of a *dead* PID, which by definition has no concurrent writer. `mori_log_release` (host finalizer / create-fail) decrements a process-global live-region count and, at zero, closes+unlinks the log and `rmdir`s the now-empty dir — so the dir tracks the live-region set as the per-region markers did, but driven by finalization. The count is incremented unconditionally so it stays balanced when logging itself fails (which forfeits only reapability, never the region). Fork-safe: `mori_log_fork_guard` reopens the log when `getpid()` changes (the inherited fd is the parent's — closed, never unlinked). Crash semantics match the regions': a `write()` is visible cross-process via the page cache without `fsync` and survives the writer's death, lost only on reboot. Path resolution (`mori_log_dir`) is pure — builds/caches the path but never creates the dir (`mori_log_append` retries through `mkdir` on `ENOENT` and is the sole creator), so a reap on a process with no log opens nothing and leaves nothing behind. All log ops best-effort.
- **Windows**: Page-file-backed via `CreateFileMappingA` / `MapViewOfFile`. `kernel32` is always available. Host must keep the mapping handle alive until consumers have opened it (the GC-chained host extptr handles this).
